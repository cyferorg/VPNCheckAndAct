<h2>VPN Check and Act Privacy Statement</h2>
<p>No personal information is processed or collected. In fact, no information whatsoever leaves your computer/device. The only information held and used is the information the user enters through the application's user interface (VPN names, tests and processes to terminate). This information is held locally on the computer/device. All the information generated during the running of the application is visible to the user in the log which is displayed on the application's main page. This information is deleted when the application is terminated.</p>
<p>
You may have noticed that VPN Check and Act requires the following permissions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Access all your files, peripheral devices, apps, programs and registry</li>
<li>Access your Internet connection</li>
</ul>
<p>These are required so that the network configuration can be checked for the presence of a VPN, and for the running processes to be viewed and terminated. No files. peripheral devices, apps etc are accessed by VPN Check and Act. Unfortunately, the level of permission granularity that can be specified does not allow for the permissions that VPN Check and Act requires without also having access to all these other permissions.
